# Softuni_React_2023_Exam_Project

## A book rating app built with React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose, including all CRUD operations

* The app gives users an opportunity to register and add books to a certain category. They can post as many books as they wish, setting a title, author, published year, cover image and category.
* The project deploys what has been included in the SoftUni React Course:
    * React components
    * React router
    * Authentication and authorization
    * JSX
    * Hooks
    * State
    * Forms
    * Storing data in a database (Mongo DB)

* The style of the app is accomplished manually by using HTML and SCSS.
